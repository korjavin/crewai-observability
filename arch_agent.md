# Task for Architecture Agent: Design an Observable CrewAI System

## Objective

Your task is to design a comprehensive architectural solution for a test project. The primary purpose of this project is to explore, demonstrate, and understand the advantages of traceability and observability within the `crewai` framework.

The final output should be a detailed architectural blueprint, explained in one or multiple Markdown files, divided by relevant topics.

## Functional Requirements of the Test Project

The system you design should be an AI-powered assistant capable of performing the following workflow:

1.  **Read Emails**: The system must be able to read a user's emails from Google Mail. The connection to the Google service should be handled via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, an open standard for AI-to-tool communication.

2.  **Identify Potential Events**: It needs to analyze the content of the emails to find suggestions for calendar events. This includes identifying the event topic, other participants, and any other relevant details.

3.  **Find Available Times**: Upon identifying a potential event, the system must connect to the user's Google Calendar to find empty and suitable time slots for it.

4.  **Propose and Await Approval**: The system should present the proposed event and the suggested time slots to the user. It must then wait for the user to approve one of the suggestions. This human-in-the-loop step is a critical part of the workflow.

5.  **Create Event**: If the user approves a time slot, the system must then create the event in their Google Calendar. This interaction should also be governed by the Model Context Protocol.

## Core Architectural Challenge: Deep Observability

A central requirement of this project is to achieve a high degree of observability into the entire process. The architecture must enable a user to:

-   **Understand Agent Behavior**: Gain a clear understanding of how the `crewai` agents work internally. It should be possible to see the flow of logic and data between agents.

-   **Trace Prompts**: The solution must provide the ability to trace the exact prompts that agents are serving to the underlying language models (LLMs).

-   **Adhere to Best Practices**: The design should not reinvent the wheel. It must incorporate industry best practices and leverage robust, open-source components for the observability and tracing tasks.

Your final architectural documents should clearly explain how this level of insight will be achieved.
