# Task 15 Remediation: Resolving `crewai-tools` Dependency Issues

**Description:**

This task provides guidance on how to resolve the dependency issues with `crewai-tools` and the `BaseTool` import path. The key is to pin the versions of `crewai` and `crewai-tools` to a known stable version and to use the correct import path for `BaseTool`.

**Guidance:**

1.  **Pin the `crewai` and `crewai-tools` versions:** In your `pyproject.toml` file, pin the versions of `crewai` and `crewai-tools` to the following versions:

    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    python = "^3.10"
    crewai = "0.28.8"
    crewai_tools = "0.1.6"
    # ... other dependencies
    ```

2.  **Update your dependencies:** After updating the `pyproject.toml` file, run the following commands to update your dependencies:

    ```bash
    poetry lock
    poetry install
    ```

3.  **Use the correct import path for `BaseTool`:** With `crewai-tools` version `0.1.6`, the correct import path for `BaseTool` is:

    ```python
    from crewai_tools import BaseTool
    ```

By following this guidance, you should be able to resolve the dependency issues and get your tests running.
