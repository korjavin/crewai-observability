# Task 6: Implement the Crew Workflow

**Description:**

Create the `crew.py` file to orchestrate the agents and tasks into a sequential crew, as described in `docs/COMPONENTS.md`.

**Requirements:**

1.  Create a file named `src/crewai_observability/crew.py`.
2.  Implement the `SchedulingCrew` class.
3.  The `SchedulingCrew` class should define the agents and tasks using the `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files.
4.  The `SchedulingCrew` class should define a sequential crew that executes the tasks in the correct order.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The `SchedulingCrew` class is implemented in `src/crewai_observability/crew.py`.
*   The crew correctly orchestrates the agents and tasks.
