# Task 14 Remediation: Debugging Agent Initialization Tests

**Description:**

This task provides guidance on how to debug the `AssertionError` when testing the agent initialization in `tests/unit/test_agents.py`. The key is to inspect the actual arguments being passed to the `Agent` constructor and to use mocking strategies that are robust to complex arguments.

**Guidance:**

1.  **Inspect the `call_args` of the mock:** Instead of trying to guess the correct arguments for your assertion, you can inspect the `call_args` attribute of your mock object to see what arguments are actually being passed. This can help you to identify any discrepancies between your test and the actual code.

    ```python
    from unittest.mock import patch, ANY

    @patch('src.crewai_observability.crew.Agent')
    def test_email_triage_agent(self, mock_agent):
        # ... (your test setup)

        # Inspect the call arguments
        print(mock_agent.call_args)

        # ... (your assertions)
    ```

2.  **Use `ANY` for complex arguments:** For arguments that are complex or difficult to replicate in your test, such as the tool instances, you can use `unittest.mock.ANY`. This will match any value for that argument.

    ```python
    from unittest.mock import ANY

    mock_agent.assert_any_call(
        config=self.crew.agents_config['email_triage_agent'],
        tools=[ANY],
        verbose=True
    )
    ```

3.  **Break down the assertion:** Instead of trying to assert all the arguments in a single `assert_called_with` call, you can break down the assertion into smaller, more manageable parts. This can make it easier to identify the source of the error.

    ```python
    # Get the call arguments
    args, kwargs = mock_agent.call_args

    # Assert the config argument
    self.assertEqual(kwargs['config'], self.crew.agents_config['email_triage_agent'])

    # Assert the number of tools
    self.assertEqual(len(kwargs['tools']), 1)
    ```

By following this guidance, you should be able to debug the `AssertionError` and get your tests to pass.
